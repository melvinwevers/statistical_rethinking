“Science is a population-level process of variation and selective retention. 
It does not operate on individual hypotheses, but rather on populations of hypotheses. It comprises a mix of dynamics that may, over long periods of time, reveal the clockwork of nature.” 


"A good theory specifies precise predictions that provide precise tests, and more than one
model is usually necessary"

"A persistent problem is design with low signal-to-noise ratios. Poor signal will not mean
no findings, just unreliable ones"
